# MegaGrok Site (Mock Next.js Project)

This is a minimal scaffold for the MegaGrok Metaverse website.
It includes:
- Pages: Home, GrokDex, Leaderboard, Comics, Tokenomics
- Components: Header, Countdown
- Mock APIs: /api/grokdex, /api/leaderboard, /api/countdown
- Public: cover1.jpg (uploaded cover used as hero background)

To run locally:
1. `npm install`
2. `npm run dev`
(This project targets Next.js 15 per user request; adjust versions as needed.)

NOTE: The uploaded comic cover was copied from `/mnt/data/Cover1.jpg` into /public/cover1.jpg
